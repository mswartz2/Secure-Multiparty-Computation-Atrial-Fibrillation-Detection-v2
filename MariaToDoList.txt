To do list

General Python:
- Add logger to everthing
- Refactor graphing
- Add something to reject record if it is too noisy
- Shuffle data and save data folds
- Train 10 models and save as pickle files
- Add comments to everything
- Set up params


GNS3 Prep:
- Get TCP communication working
- Get HTTP communication working
- Set up scipts with params for different experiments

GNS3:
- Get files loaded in to docker container
- Set up basic environment with clients, server, orchestrator
- Run experiments
    - With original train/test data
        - Preprocessing & feature extraction at client
        - Preprocessing & feature extraction at server
    - With 10 different folds for train/test data
        - Preprocessing & feature extraction at client
        - Preprocessing & feature extraction at server


Possibly Later:
- Different noise reduction techniques
- Improve feature extraction
